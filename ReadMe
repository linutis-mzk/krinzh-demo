# Krinzh

This is a personal project designed to personalise Twitch experience. This is done by simplifying the UI by including only the necessary elements. This is early stage application, designed with data analytics in-mind. The site comes with custom domain Krinzh.com and signed SSL certificates. 
`The site is currently offline.`



## Projects
* **Krinzh** - .NET Core backend of the website. Responds to HTTP requests and delivers standard website files to the user i.e. HTML, Javascript and CSS. Also initialises and populates the database.
* **Krinzh : Frontend** - React and Typescript GUI element of the app styled using SaSS.
* **TwitchAPI** - Windows background service that communicates with Twitch.com API. Sends requests at rate dependant on user's settings and stores retrieved data in the database.
* **UnitTests** - Collection of tests used to perform functional checks.


## Tech Stack

* **PostgreSQL**
*  **.NET Core 7**
* **React Hooks**
* **NUnit**
* **Docker-Compose**
* **SaSS**
* **WebPack**

## Next Steps
Currently, Twitch streamers of interest are pre-defined in the database. This can be changed by allowing users to login with their Twitch account and instead show the people they follow. In addition, a streamer filtering mechanism can be implemented. In terms of data analytics, data collected should now be processed to create useful insights such as who has the highest number of viewers and how that view count gets impacted depending on the time of day/week/month. Furthermore, data will be collected from Reddit, Twitter, and other social media posts, filtered through the use of language processing and clustering algorithms, and displayed to the user. I intend to use Python libraries which consequently will involve writing Django Web API.
